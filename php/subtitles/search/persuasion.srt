00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,375
[Anne] <i>I almost got married once.</i>

4
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,375
<i>Wentworth held my heart.</i>

5
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:14,750
<i>But he was a sailor</i>
<i>without rank or fortune.</i>

6
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,042
<i>And I was persuaded to give him up.</i>

7
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,250
[music slows down, then stops]

[Anne] <i>Now I'm single and thriving.</i>

10
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,750
<i>I spend my time drinking fine wines,</i>

11
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,375
<i>enjoying warm baths…</i>

12
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,833
<i>and lying face down on my bed.</i>

13
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,708
<i>Like I said, thriving.</i>

14
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,375
<i>Who needs romance</i>

15

[playful music continues]

17
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,042
My father.

18
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,833
He's never met a reflective surface
he didn't like.

19
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,958
Vanity is the beginning and end
of his character.

20
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,083
Also the middle.

21
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,958
"Sir Walter Elliot,

22
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,375
born March 1st, 1760."

23
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,875
"Man of consequence,

24
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,667
known for his exquisite jawline."

25
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:43,458
[Anne] He is the sole object
of his own warmest respect and devotion.

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,417
[sighs] One's family is only escapable
by two things,

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,583
marriage and death.

28
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,292
Both seem unlikely
in the immediate future.

29
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,333
"Married July 15th, 1784, to Jane."

30
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,250
My mother.

31
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,167
-I miss her.
-[Sir Walter] "Jane died in 1801."

32
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,375
"By her, Sir Walter issued
three children."

33
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:09,833
My sisters.

34
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,833
[Sir Walter] "Elizabeth, celebrated beauty

35
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:16,250
and Somerset's
most fashion-forward luminary."

36
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,417
Elizabeth, the eldest.

37
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,667
[Sir Walter] "Mary,
married to Charles Musgrove,

38
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,083
heir to the superior Uppercross estate."

39
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,958
Mary, the youngest.

40
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:30,208
"And Anne, born August 9th, 1787."

41
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,458
And me, middle child,

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,917
the crack in his looking glass.

43
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,000
Shame there wasn't anything nice
we could think to add about you, Anne.

44
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,833
Thanks for trying.

45
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,333
You're welcome.
I wanted to leave you out entirely,

46
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,708
but Daddy thought
people might think you had died.

47
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,708
-Debt collectors.
-[Elizabeth] Daddy. Daddy!

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,750
[Anne] <i>The one thing my father loves more</i>
<i>than himself is spending money.</i>

49
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,250
<i>It was always going to run out one day.</i>

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,583
-Daddy…
-Daddy's broke, princess.

51
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,000
Playtime's over.

52
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,250
Oh!

53
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,542
[lawyer] There, there, Sir Walter.

54
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,333
Lots of people face debt
at some point in their lives.

55
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,917
You must retrench.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,958
You have no choice.

57
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,458
I've drawn up a vigorous plan of economy.

58
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,750
The most necessary reductions
are underlined.

59
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,833
Meet my mother's best friend
and unflinching speaker of truth.

60
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,833
Lady Russell took it on herself

61
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,958
to give me advice on every topic
as she felt my mother would have.

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,792
Always insightful and helpful.

63
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,875
With one… notable exception.

64
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:55,208
Some people don't have homes or food.
Try to put this into perspective.

65
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:56,625
Mr. Shepherd,

66
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:00,042
if I was interested in gaining perspective
by thinking of the poor,

67
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,500
I'd ask you the rate
charged by your barber.

68
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,292
Don't ask me to change things
by seeing them differently.

69
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:09,958
See things my way,
then change them until they are different.

70
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,458
Perhaps we need only stop
giving to charities.

71
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,042
Do we do that?

72
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,333
Jane would be ashamed.

73
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:22,458
She begged me to protect her daughters
from their father's excessive excesses

74
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,667
and I have failed.

75
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,292
Your arrogance will bankrupt them all.

76
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,208
Father,

77
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,292
true reputation comes

78
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:34,708
from honesty, integrity, compassion,

79
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,500
acceptance of responsibility
for the welfare of others.

80
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,292
Anne, we're speaking
of something substantial.

81
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,792
Try to keep up.

82
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,833
Why not downsize
and move somewhere cheaper?

83
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,542
Bath is lovely.

84
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,875
And the spas there
will work wonders for your skin.

85
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,542
And what of Kellynch Hall?

86
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,125
Just the other day
I met a wealthy naval officer

87
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,958
who would pay a handsome rent
for a house like Kellynch.

88
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,542
I will not have a Navy man in my house.

89
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,542
-They're all ugly.
-Admiral Croft is quite handsome.

90
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,458
Admiral? What right has the British Navy

91
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:12,917
to bring persons of obscure birth
into undue distinction?

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,583
Only God has the right to bestow rank.

93
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,958
What good is a title
if you have to earn it?

94
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,250
What good is anything
if you have to earn it?

95
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,208
Admiral Croft is a fine gentleman.

96
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:28,833
His wife told me about a brother
who lived among us a few years back.

97
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,167
He was also a naval officer.

98
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,875
What was his name? Uh, Wellington?

99
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,708
Weathers? Winslow?

100
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:36,917
You mean Wentworth?

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,333
-[Mr. Shepherd] Wentworth? Yes.
-Anne, darling.

102
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,167
In truth, I can hardly remember
who you are speaking of.

103
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,000
[Sir Walter] You really think
my skin will do well in Bath?

104
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,250
[Lady Russell] Oh, yes.

105
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,833
-[Lady Russell] Yes.
-[knock on door]

106
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,792
Sweetheart… it's been seven years.

107
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,708
Eight.

108
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,750
You couldn't possibly still feel--

109
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,833
I do.

110
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,625
Frederick Wentworth was the only person,

111
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,083
save you and my mother,

112
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,375
who ever really saw me.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,250
And understood me.

114
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,208
And loved me.

115
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:20,875
Aw.

116
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,167
And the only one I wanted to--

117
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,542
Exchange calling cards with?

118
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:28,750
Well put.

119
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,167
You lied when you told me
time would heal me of my pain.

120
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,667
-You're angry with me.
-I'm angry with myself.

121
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,333
For… being persuaded.

122
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,000
For not seeing then
what I see so clearly now.

123
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,542
That I would have been
a far happier woman in keeping him

124
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,750
than I have been in giving him up.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,833
Hmm.

126
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry. The truth is,
marriage is transactional for women.

127
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,750
Our basic security is on the line.

128
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,333
I could not let you throw yourself away
on a man with no rank,

129
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,542
no fortune,

130
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,833
nothing but himself to recommend him.

131
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,708
That was the part I liked.

132
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,917
Besides, all of his confidence
was justified. He is rich now.

133
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,833
And a captain.

134
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,708
Then, why haven't you heard from him?

135
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,500
Because…

136
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,042
I broke his heart.

137
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,292
And he knew why.

138
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,625
I thought I was protecting you.
I was wrong.

139
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,167
I see that now.

140
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,667
And I'm sorry.

141
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,083
[sighs]

142
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,292
You will find the one
that's meant for you.

143
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,208
The one who loves you enough
to fight for you.

144
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,125
Darling, I admire how strongly
you feel about it,

145
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,333
but at some point, you have to move on.

146
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,167
I fear Wentworth is a ship
that has sailed,

147
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,625
so I say this with love.

148
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,917
Abandon all hope.

149
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,125
[receding footsteps]

150
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,333
It's true, he hasn't written to me.

151
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,500
But… I knew he wouldn't.

152
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,375
[sniffs]

153
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,542
He respects himself too much to beg.

154
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,250
He didn't fight for me because

155
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,583
he could never value
a love that wasn't offered freely.

156
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,083
I'm sure he's put it all behind him.

157
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,667
I, on the other hand,

158
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,708
have kept it painfully in front of me.

159
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,458
[playful instrumental music]

160
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,958
The first note he passed me in church.

161
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,917
The playlist he made me.

162
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,833
One lock of hair from him.

163
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:36,458
And one from his horse, Sampson,
whom I scarcely knew.

164
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,000
And this cow bell,

165
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:45,125
whose sad, empty knell
best captures my melancholy.

166
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,208
[clangs]

167
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,250
Eight years of it.

168
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,625
He's been all over.

169
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,583
And the Navy adores him.

170
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,750
"Frederick Wentworth turns a pretty penny
aboard the Laconia."

171
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,083
"Frederick Wentworth
rescues a beached whale

172
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,667
as onlookers weep."

173
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,417
And yet… no marriage announcement.

174
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,917
Nothing at all to indicate

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,958
he's since been in any way
attached to another.

176
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,083
In other words…

177
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:27,125
hope springs eternal.

178
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,417
[laughter in the room]

179
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,167
[Elizabeth] As we're moving,
I need to think about my Bath persona.

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think Bath Elizabeth should be
less sophisticated than London Elizabeth,

181
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,833
but not as free-spirited
as country Elizabeth.

182
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,833
Penelope, what do you think?

183
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,208
You'll accompany the Elliots north,
Mrs. Clay?

184
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, I wouldn't dream of imposing.

185
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,208
Of course you would.
You dream of nothing but.

186
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,875
And lucky for you, I wouldn't dream
of going anywhere without you.

187
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,875
Mrs. Penelope Clay,

188
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,750
widowed, though she never speaks of it.

189
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,458
He was a corpse when they met, so perhaps
the transition escaped her attention.

190
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,792
Lady Russell worries
that Mrs. Clay has designs on my father,

191
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,167
but I don't think she's his type.

192
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,125
Besides, can you actually imagine
my father marrying down?

193
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,292
Oh, you must come,
if your father can spare you.

194
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,792
Mr. Shepherd, do you think
you can spare Penelope?

195
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,833
Hmm.

196
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,583
Good, fine, exquisite, Sir Walter.
[chuckles]

197
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,750
You really are too generous
for your own good! [laughs]

198
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,208
[Sir Walter] We'll need
your pleasant company

199
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,917
to make amends for the many plain faces
we shall have to endure in Bath.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,292
Now, Sir Walter,
not everyone was made to be handsome.

201
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,583
Your beauty will shine
twice as brightly amongst them.

202
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,208
It is said if you're a five in London,
you're a ten in Bath.

203
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:51,208
Well, just think,

204
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,000
you and Elizabeth,
you'll be thirteens there.

205
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,250
[Sir Walter and Elizabeth laugh]

206
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,542
You'll be at least a six, Anne.

207
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,500
[Mr. Shepherd slurps]

208
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,083
[Elizabeth] Anyway, Anne won't be
joining us for quite some time.

209
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,792
What?

210
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,208
I got a letter from Mary today.

211
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,000
She's ill again and needs you
at Uppercross immediately.

212
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,833
I know you barely tolerate her.

213
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:18,125
Still, it's a more positive reaction
than anyone else has towards her,

214
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,458
making you the logical choice.

215
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,167
[Mr. Shepherd slurps]

216
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,583
Fabulous.

217
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,250
[Elizabeth] Make sure the nice linens
are hidden before the admiral arrives.

218
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,167
Why? Do you think they'll steal them?

219
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,792
I don't like the idea
of their naked skin on my sheets.

220
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,375
It might bring you luck.

221
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,875
And hide the ledgers.
I don't want anyone assuming my identity.

222
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,042
I don't think anyone wants your credit
at this point, Father.

223
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:49,417
Oh, and remind them, in a gentle way,

224
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,667
never to go anywhere near my rose garden.

225
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,833
Oh, yes, please. And the shrubberies.

226
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,083
I don't like the idea of my shrubberies
being enjoyed by others.

227
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
Use the scratchy linen,

228
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,625
don't set foot in the garden
and don't look at the shrubberies.

229
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,500
Any other hospitable words?

230
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:10,125
That is all. Oh, but please make sure
every room is spotless before they arrive.

231
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,583
I don't want rumors circulating
about dust.

232
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,750
[playful music stops]

233
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,333
[melancholic music plays]

234
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,542
[birds chirping]

235
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,042
[Admiral Croft] Oh.

236
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,667
It's even more incredible
than we were told.

237
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,917
You mustn't worry,
we'll be excellent tenants.

238
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,958
Do you always travel with your husband?

239
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,417
Oh, yes. And no one will ever stop me.

240
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,417
[Anne chuckles]

241
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,375
I've crossed the Atlantic four times,

242
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:00,750
gone once to the East Indies
and back again.

243
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,375
Cork, Lisbon, Gibraltar…

244
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,125
The happiest moments of my life
have been spent aboard a ship.

245
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,875
You're very lucky.

246
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,792
[Mrs. Croft] You'll see
when you're in love.

247
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,667
You know, Anne,
Mrs. Croft's baby brother is a bachelor.

248
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,792
He's a captain in the Navy,
quite successful.

249
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,167
Edward, please don't.

250
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,250
A woman without a husband
is not a problem to be solved.

251
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,500
-I knew your brother, actually.
-[Mrs. Croft] Did you?

252
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,250
-Oh, how wonderful.
-[Anne chuckles]

253
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,167
Perhaps we can all have dinner together
once he joins us.

254
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,083
Joins you?

255
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,958
-[Mrs. Croft] His ship just docked.
-[Admiral] He'll be here in two days.

256
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,125
These gardens are so beautiful.

257
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:47,917
[music continues]

258
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,333
I wonder how he feels as to a meeting.

259
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,708
If he'd wished to see me before now,
he need not have waited.

260
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,458
He's angry still, I'm sure.

261
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,708
What if I've been wrong?

262
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:18,125
What if he's been pining for me
day and night all these years?

263
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,292
[music rising]

264
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,583
[coachman] Whoa there!

265
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,292
Here you are.

266
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,000
[music slows down]

267
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,667
[Mary] Can someone help me?

268
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,208
Mary is preferable to Elizabeth

269
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,958
in that she's a total narcissist.

270
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:14,000
So, conversing with her
requires very little energy

271
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,917
and can be great fun.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,083
Once, I went an entire 24 hours

273
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,917
speaking exclusively in Italian.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,500
She only noticed
when I asked her to pass the <i>sale</i>.

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She's so wrapped up in her own suffering

276
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,375
that, until I clear my throat,
she won't even notice I'm here.

277
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,292
Watch.

278
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,750
First, she'll complain
about some unidentifiable ailment

279
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,583
that has her on the verge of death.

280
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:39,250
Next, she'll rail against her husband
for not caring for her properly.

281
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,917
And then she will assault her in-laws,

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,250
who constantly disrespect her
and must secretly despise her.

283
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:49,875
[clears throat]

284
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,667
I'm monstrously relieved you're here.

285
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,417
I don't know what it is.
A bug of some sort.

286
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:59,250
I can't move. I'm on the verge of death.

287
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,958
Charles is out shooting,
not a single caring word on his way out.

288
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,208
Hmm.

289
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,833
And my in-laws sent me
that lovely bouquet.

290
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:08,833
Isn't that sweet?

291
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,750
They'll rot, and I'll feel worse
than if they hadn't sent anything at all.

292
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,708
Hmm.

293
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,292
How unkind is it
to remind a dying person of decay?

294
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,708
Anne, these people hate me.

295
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:23,333
The children are monsters,
the house is drafty

296
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,167
and nobody cares
about the theater anymore.

297
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,333
Precisely, Anne, yes.

298
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,833
-Anne!
-Anne!

299
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,333
Meet my sisters in-law,

300
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,542
Henrietta and Louisa Musgrove.

301
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,792
They are beautiful in every way.

302
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,125
-Anne!
-[Anne] Girls!

303
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,917
We were so glad
when Mary said that you'd come.

304
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,833
We've been positively giddy all week.

305
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,125
You must promise to spend
every waking second with us, no excuses.

306
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,167
[Mary clears throat]

307
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,542
When you aren't attending
to your sister of course.

308
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,500
-How are you feeling, Mary?
-You haven't asked me how I'm feeling.

309
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,250
-I just did.
-[Mary] I'm close to death.

310
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,125
I can feel my organs decomposing.

311
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,917
-[giggling]
-Same as yesterday, then.

312
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,042
Encouraging that, though her organs rot,
her personality remains as fresh as ever.

313
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,042
[all laugh]

314
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,333
Anne, you must dine with us every night,
delight us with your playing,

315
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:12,958
because we will do nothing
but dance and sing and laugh.

316
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:14,667
[kids] Marie Antoinette!

317
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,792
[Anne] How dare you speak my name,
you naughty subjects!

318
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,333
Careful, boys,
ladies don't like to be trampled.

319
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,000
And your mother has a headache.

320
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,792
To have things near your face
when you don't know where they've been!

321
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,042
We're hungry, Marie Antoinette.

322
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,625
-Well, let them eat cake!
-[Charles] No cake until after supper.

323
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,542
There'll be special guests tonight.
We'll meet Admiral Croft and his wife.

324
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,500
She's bringing her brother,
Frederick Wentworth.

325
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,125
Just arrived this morning, we hear.
A gallant captain!

326
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,875
I heard he once redirected
an entire flotilla

327
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,333
to save a beached whale.

328
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,250
[Mary] I had no idea
you were fond of whales.

329
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,542
[chuckles]

330
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,667
-Have you ever met Captain Wentworth?
-In passing, long ago.

331
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:59,500
-Is it true he's devastatingly handsome?
-He has a kind face, yes.

332
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,208
And is it true he actually listens
when women speak?

333
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,583
He listens.

334
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,167
He listens with his whole body.

335
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,500
It's… electrifying.

336
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, then, he sounds like
just the man for you.

337
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,625
-I insist you pursue him.
-Louisa…

338
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,125
No, no. I've made up my mind, Anne.

339
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,542
No more hiding your light
underneath a bushel.

340
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,333
You are very sweet, but I'm not interested

341
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:30,167
in receiving instruction
on where to put my light.

342
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,042
Or my bushel.

343
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,083
[giggles]

344
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,375
Tell me, honestly, why aren't you married?

345
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,167
I'm waiting to fall in love.

346
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:46,458
All right, here's what you'll do.
At dinner, you'll sit right next to him.

347
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,667
I'll sit right next to him.

348
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,500
Then, you'll pretend
not to know a thing about anything.

349
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
Men like explaining things.

350
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:57,000
Tell him you've never used utensils,
ask him to teach you how to hold them.

351
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,458
Is this how they're teaching courtship
these days?

352
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:03,167
Then, just when he starts
to seem interested,

353
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,625
don't respond to a single thing he says.

354
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,958
As though you're a ghost.

355
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,375
He'll be hooked. [giggles]

356
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,375
So, then, just be myself.

357
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,250
Oh no. Don't do that until at least
the second year of marriage.

358
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,625
That may not be the worst advice.

359
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,750
-Mary!
-Charles. What happened?

360
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,708
Mary, help. He's hurt his arm.

361
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,375
-[Mary] What has he done?
-He fell from a tree.

362
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,333
Of course this happens the one evening
people of interest are set to visit.

363
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,958
He didn't fall on purpose, Mary.

364
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,917
Someone will have to stay with him.

365
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,375
I'll bring you back some plum pudding.

366
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,208
So, it's the mother who must stay, then.

367
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,708
It's not enough
I brought these humans into the world,

368
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,875
I must now miss dinners
on account of them.

369
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,417
This is just my luck.

370
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,042
If there is anything disagreeable,
men are sure to get out of it.

371
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,167
Mary, my sweet, he's hurt.

372
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,667
And you aren't feeling
quite yourself either.

373
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,833
Oh no, that's cleared up entirely.

374
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,708
I'm sure the Crofts will come again.

375
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,625
Oh, I hate my life.

376
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,875
If it's really bothering you,
I'm happy to stay with you.

377
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,917
That goes without saying.
Of course. I'm not gonna stay alone.

378
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Wouldn't it be hard to be away from
little Charles when he's in so much pain?

379
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,875
No, Louisa.

380
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,167
Please understand.

381
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,000
The thing about me is, I am an empath.

382
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:39,042
I'm actually the least equipped to be
with my children when they're suffering

383
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,583
because I feel it so deeply.

384
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,583
It's much better for me to be away.

385
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,958
Life is so much easier for people
like Anne who aren't so sensitive.

386
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,333
Mary, would you like me to stay alone
while you go to dinner?

387
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,417
That's so kind.
I'll bring you back some plum pudding.

388
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,583
And perhaps a crust of bread
and some gruel?

389
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,583
Don't worry, Anne, I'll talk you up.

390
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:08,625
I'll paint such a pretty picture, he'll be
ready to propose by morning. Promise.

391
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,667
[door closes]

392
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,125
[slow melancholic music]

393
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,167
[music continues]

394
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
[sighs]

395
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,458
If only I could talk to him.

396
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:37,750
[sighs]

397
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,083
[music becomes playful]

398
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,417
Frederick!

399
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,542
[woman] Oh.

400
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,458
Oh!

401
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,333
Oh. Ouch.

402
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,625
[dog barks in distance]

403
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,250
[gasps]

404
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,583
[sighs]

405
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,458
[sighs]

406
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:00,250
Perfect.

407
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,667
[music stops]

408
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,750
[screaming and laughter]

409
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,542
Thanks again for last night, Anne.

410
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,083
I really think
you would have liked Captain Wentworth.

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,125
Um, this jam is too soggy.

412
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,417
I'd rather not have jam at all
if it is to be soggy.

413
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,208
I want to be a captain.

414
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,542
Absolutely not.

415
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,833
No nephew of mine will be a sailor.

416
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:28,250
Don't you know
they have to wear silly hats?

417
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,292
Anne, please, I can't endure
the sound of laughter before noon.

418
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,458
And the rules are

419
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,875
you must grow a silly mustache.

420
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,500
[kids laugh]

421
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,000
-Mm.
-[Mary] No.

422
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,833
[Charles] Wentworth doesn't have
a mustache, but he is quite impressive.

423
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,042
Handsome, intelligent, rich.

424
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,167
-[child] Do it again!
-[Anne] Oh, look at me.

425
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,667
I'm Captain Wentworth
and I am very impressive!

426
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm rich and I'm handsome
and everybody loves me!

427
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:57,708
And I'm a sailor!

428
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:00,250
[Charles] Uh, Captain,
meet Mary's sister, Anne.

429
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,667
-Actually, we… We've met.
-We've met.

430
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,875
-Oh
-Long ago, before I was rich.

431
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:13,250
But not before I was handsome.

432
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,375
You look… old.

433
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,375
-I didn't mean that.
-What did you mean?

434
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:25,042
Old… Older… than you used to look.

435
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:28,917
-Your face has matured.
-Small price to pay for a life of purpose.

436
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,917
-Are you implying my life lacks purpose?
-How would I know?

437
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,625
Your hair remains intact.

438
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,875
Your hair is also

439
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:41,000
suitably appropriate.

440
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,833
-Thank you.
-So, then, you two really have met.

441
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:50,958
-Fleetingly.
-And yet memorable in its fleetingness.

442
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:58,667
Shall we go?

443
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,125
-We shall.
-Yes.

444
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,042
Oh.

445
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,708
[Anne sighs]

446
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,333
-What?
-You still have jam on your face.

447
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,708
[laughs]

448
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,083
[slow instrumental music]

449
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,625
[indistinct chatter]

450
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,125
My dress is soaked.

451
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,667
[Louisa] I told you he'd be back, Anne.
Why don't you sit next to him?

452
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,917
[Anne, sighing] Louisa.

453
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,250
[indistinct]

454
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,333
[music continues]

455
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,000
-Do come through here.
-[Mrs. Croft] Thank you so much.

456
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:01,167
Captain Wentworth,
I'm going to keep you next to me.

457
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:02,917
[Frederick] Certainly.

458
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:09,667
Louisa.

459
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,125
How perfect.

460
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,083
[music stops]

461
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,708
[playful instrumental music]

462
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,167
-[Louisa] I'll sit next to you.
-I'll get your chair.

463
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,958
Thank you very much.

464
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,417
[people chatting indistinctly]

465
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:00,542
[loud scraping]

466
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,625
Light under bushel, check.

467
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,333
[people chatting indistinctly]

468
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,167
-By the stem?
-By the stem.

469
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,292
Quite the upgrade.

470
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,167
From what?

471
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,917
From whoever didn't want
to sit next to me.

472
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:37,458
Now, tell me, do you have
the same trouble with spoons?

473
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,500
Thank you.

474
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:46,667
[Frederick] Thank you.
[Louisa] Thank you very much.

475
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,583
Enjoying it. It's delicious.

476
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:57,292
[both laugh]

477
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:00,333
Captain Wentworth was telling me
how he almost died at sea.

478
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:03,417
My, captain! What made you decide
on such a risky profession?

479
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,875
When I first left shore,
I was in great need of distraction.

480
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,875
For that, the constant threat on my life
was useful.

481
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,500
In fact, I was in such despair,
there were times I almost wished for it.

482
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,000
Would it be too bold to ask
the source of such desperation?

483
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,083
A woman.

484
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,542
Well, then, her loss.

485
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,958
Now, though,
I've had my fill of excitement.

486
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,375
I long for absolute boredom
to lull me back to myself.

487
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,208
And by that you mean a wife?

488
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,625
Mother!

489
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:37,083
I mean, people and things
I can be quiet with, yes.

490
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,083
Who better to be quiet with than a wife?

491
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,000
Mother!

492
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,875
-Are you in the market for a wife, boy?
-Father!

493
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,042
No, you found me out.

494
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,625
Here I am, ashore,
looking to make a foolish match.

495
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,000
A little kindness, a strong mind,

496
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,750
a few compliments to the Navy,
and I'm a lost man.

497
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,792
Anyone between the ages of 18 and 80
may have me for the asking.

498
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,583
[laughter]

499
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,667
Almost anyone.

500
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,417
Charles wanted to marry me first.

501
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,083
[Mrs. Musgrove] What's that, Anne?

502
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,417
Um…

503
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:12,125
Uh, just speaking of marriage.

504
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,458
Um… [clears throat]

505
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:18,542
Remember how Charles wanted
to marry me before he married Charles?

506
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,458
I mean Mary.

507
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,542
Sorry, Charles, um…

508
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,583
Before she married…

509
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:29,750
Sorry, before he, of course <i>he</i>,

510
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:33,375
came to his senses and married Mary.

511
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,708
Please go on. You'd like us to understand

512
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,708
that your brother-in-law
once preferred you to your sister?

513
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,375
-That's true, yes.
-It's true.

514
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:45,417
Yes, it's quite right. There, there.

515
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:49,958
[soft piano music]

516
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,292
Wentworth isn't very gallant to you, Anne.

517
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,417
He said you were so altered
he hardly recognized you.

518
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,375
Don't worry, I stood up for you.

519
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:15,292
I told him your eye got so infected
it swelled shut for a week

520
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,083
and then we all called you Blackbeard.

521
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,500
I suppose that isn't sticking up for you
so much as just saying a thing.

522
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,500
Yes, I suppose it was more that.

523
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,542
[indistinct]

524
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:37,375
More, Anne, please. Play for us, maestro.

525
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,125
[soft piano music resumes]

526
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,333
[piano fades]

527
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:17,333
[melancholic instrumental music]

528
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,958
[Anne] He was so distant last night.

529
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,292
I'd prefer open hostility.

530
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:51,375
His cold politeness and ceremonious grace
are worse than anything.

531
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,792
"Beg your pardon, Miss Elliot,

532
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,458
is this your chair?"

533
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,083
[screams]

534
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,500
Love me, you idiot!

535
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:04,042
Love me or kill me now! I can't bear it!

536
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,917
[clears throat]

537
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,458
Lady Macbeth.

538
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:11,667
Act three, scene four.

539
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:13,708
She'll buy it.

540
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,917
Oh, right.

541
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,333
How are you this morning, Mary?

542
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:22,500
I'm still dizzy from watching
Wentworth spin Louisa around all evening.

543
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,542
Or as much as he could manage
with you plonk-plonking sad-sack tunes.

544
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,708
"Für Elise" happens to be
a great dance song

545
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:33,667
for those sophisticated enough
to explore less traditional movements.

546
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,833
And how would you dance to Beethoven?

547
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,292
Alone in my room with a bottle of red.

548
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,417
Frederick will surely propose to Louisa.

549
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,042
Then they'll be married
and then Louisa will be happy forever.

550
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,667
Why must everyone always assume
that all women want

551
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,250
is to be chosen by any eligible bachelor?

552
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,458
Because marriage is the greatest blessing
that life can offer.

553
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,000
Where are your children?

554
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:01,667
How should I know?

555
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:14,667
Nobody tells you when you're young
that life keeps going.

556
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,542
It keeps going whether you approve
of the progression or not.

557
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,333
[sighs] And, eventually,
you find yourself wondering,

558
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,500
"How did I end up here?"

559
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:31,792
A heartbeat ago, there were no two souls
more in rhythm than Wentworth and I.

560
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,000
Now we're strangers.

561
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,250
Worse than strangers.

562
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,250
[sighs] We're exes.

563
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,125
[James] Auntie Anne.

564
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,375
-Where are you?
-Come and play.

565
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,000
[kids scream]

566
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,833
[romantic instrumental music]

567
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:57,875
Ha!

568
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:00,792
Marie Antoinette, Marie Antoinette,
the people don't want you.

569
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,292
They don't want to have a queen anymore.

570
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:07,417
How dare you speak to me that way!
You are my subjects.

571
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,750
Bad queen!

572
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,083
Bad queen? Bad subject!

573
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:14,125
-Wait, what's the words again?
<i>-Vive la révolution.</i>

574
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:16,042
<i>Vive la</i> revolution!

575
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,292
Haha! This is mine. This is my crown.

576
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,417
[kids scream]

577
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
[Anne] How dare you take my crown!

578
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,625
-[kids laugh]
-[Anne] You got me!

579
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,875
-Okay. That's enough! Boys!
-Bad queen!

580
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,125
-[boys yell]
-[Anne] No!

581
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,458
That was quite reckless.
The boy could have been hurt.

582
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:43,333
You're right. I'm sorry.
We got carried away.

583
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:45,708
-Save it for Robespierre.
-Frederick!

584
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,167
I'm doing my best.

585
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,583
Your best? About what?

586
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:55,167
About you and me.
I don't want you to be angry.

587
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,792
What would you want me to be?

588
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,583
[Mary] I'm just too kind, Anne,
that's my problem.

589
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:28,125
I give all of my attention to others
and then I suffer for it.

590
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,625
[in Italian] How far is the Colosseum?

591
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,042
Mmm, you're right,
but how do I prioritize self-care

592
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,708
with everyone around me
constantly bidding for my attention?

593
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,625
[in Italian] One cappuccino, please!

594
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:43,792
What I've realized is
I need to fall in love with myself first,

595
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:47,583
and then I can truly love those around me,
and that's all there is to it.

596
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,667
Oh!

597
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,042
[in Italian] How much is that porcupine
in the window?

598
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,875
-[Mary] What's behind me?
-[in Italian] Cheese roll?

599
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,792
Are you trying to go somewhere without me
and gesturing to keep it a secret?

600
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,208
We are going for a-a walk, Mary.

601
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:11,125
-Very long walk.
-Through the woods.

602
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,458
-You hate nature.
-You hate moving your legs.

603
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,125
You made us carry you home last time.

604
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,833
So, you assume because I hate something
I don't want to do it?

605
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,583
Um…

606
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,792
[sighs] Great.

607
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,625
[insects buzz]

608
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:27,542
[giggling]

609
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,625
[Mary] Bugs everywhere.

610
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,208
-Anne.
-Hmm?

611
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,625
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you,

612
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,292
but I'm ashamed.

613
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:44,917
What is it?

614
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,667
You remember
when Captain Wentworth first came

615
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,083
and I encouraged you to pursue him?

616
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,167
Yes.

617
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,125
Well, that was before I knew him,
of course.

618
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:58,083
And I genuinely hoped
that you two would be a match.

619
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,333
Not that you seem at all interested.

620
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,250
-Don't I?
-[Louisa] You barely look at him.

621
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,375
And now you'd like him for yourself?

622
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,167
He's everything.

623
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,917
You seem surprised.

624
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,750
I suppose I am. I thought you two were--

625
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:24,292
I don't know how he feels,
but I'm falling in love.

626
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,750
I've thought quite a lot about how
I would feel were our roles reversed.

627
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,083
I might be hurt, perhaps even jealous,

628
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:36,667
but I can honestly say that any sorrow
for myself would be entirely eclipsed

629
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:39,708
by the pleasure I would take
in seeing you happy.

630
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,958
-You're trying very hard here.
-[Louisa laughs]

631
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,917
Is it working?

632
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:46,625
[Anne chuckles]

633
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,125
I don't understand
why you think you need my permission

634
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,625
if you say I barely look at him.

635
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,625
Because it's the way
you barely look at him.

636
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,375
I know what I'm watching and it's more
than two people who have merely met.

637
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:04,667
What you're seeing is… the past.

638
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,250
Look, I believe
this man could be my future.

639
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,458
[distant whistle]

640
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,500
[melancholic instrumental music]

641
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:49,792
And a frigate is larger
than a sloop, correct?

642
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:52,792
-Someone's been studying.
-[Frederick] Very good.

643
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:58,042
A sloop is crewed by 130 men or so,
while a frigate can carry 140 to 200.

644
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,792
Depending on whether
it's fifth or sixth rate, I suppose.

645
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,708
[Frederick chuckles]

646
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,167
"Now May with all her smiling trains
of vernal beauty sticks--"

647
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,250
That's more than enough poetry.
You know how much I detest metaphor.

648
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,750
[chuckling] Sorry, Mary, I'd forgotten.
My mind is like a sieve.

649
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,958
Which is a simile, not a metaphor.

650
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,125
Fine. My mind <i>is</i> a sieve.

651
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,042
Whatever your mind is,
stop using words imaginatively.

652
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:32,625
I can't bear it.

653
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:39,333
[Henrietta] Look! We could drop in
on Harry Hayter.

654
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,500
Perhaps he's worked up the nerve
to propose to me.

655
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:44,542
Not that I had any intention
for leading us in this direction.

656
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,500
No, absolutely not.
I will not enter the Hayter house.

657
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,292
I'm sure to contract
some terrible illness.

658
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:50,958
Mary, don't be ridiculous.

659
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,042
Is it ridiculous to care for one's health?

660
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:58,167
Households employing fewer
than five servants are unsanitary.

661
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,875
Please don't judge us
by our poor relations, captain.

662
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,000
It's unpleasant having such connections.

663
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,250
Just to be clear, you disapprove of him
for your sister-in-law

664
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,583
because he is not wealthy enough?

665
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,625
[Mary] I know.
It really is awful, isn't it?

666
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:19,708
Shall we?

667
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,708
[ducks quacking]

668
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,833
[playful instrumental music]

669
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:51,958
[Louisa] It's that Elliot pride.
I find it detestable.

670
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:56,250
To know Sir Walter, one might believe
the title of Baronet second only to King.

671
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:59,292
Lord knows how sweet Anne
came out of that lot.

672
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:02,667
We all so wish Charles had married her
instead. Don't you agree?

673
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,833
-Don't let her fool you.
-What do you mean?

674
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:09,875
Anne Elliot has as much pride as the rest.
It just takes a different form.

675
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,375
I don't understand.

676
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,708
Next time you witness Miss Elliot
quietly installing herself

677
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:18,292
on the outskirts of some social situation,

678
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:22,417
consider whether she might assume
this vantage in order to judge everyone.

679
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,083
Harshly.

680
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,792
Anne Elliot is pure kindness.

681
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,042
You don't know her like I do.

682
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:33,250
You are the one
who is pure kindness, Louisa,

683
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:36,167
and for this reason
you always assume the best of others.

684
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,333
The truest evidence of an inferior mind

685
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:42,542
is to allow oneself to be persuaded away
from one's deepest convictions.

686
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,333
[Louisa] What deepest convictions?

687
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,542
I won't have you speak ill of Anne.
She is too dear to me.

688
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,125
I don't know what happened between you
and I'm not asking.

689
00:42:56,625 --> 00:43:00,042
I do see the best in her,
and I implore you to look for it too.

690
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:05,083
Please forgive me. I've been too harsh.

691
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,125
Thank you for calling me to task.

692
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,000
If I forgive you,
will you teach me how to read a sextant?

693
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,125
-[Frederick] On such short acquaintance?
-I'm free this evening.

694
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,083
[both laugh]

695
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,000
[Frederick] Shall we wander?

696
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:27,958
[slow playful music]

697
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:49,708
[sighs]

698
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:54,500
[music stops]

699
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,875
There's nothing worse
than thinking your life is ruined

700
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:02,042
and then realizing
you've got much, much further to fall.

701
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:05,708
[music resumes]

702
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,042
Like I said.

703
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,625
-[birds cawing]
-[Anne groans softly]

704
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,458
[sighs deeply]

705
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,792
[indistinct chatter]

706
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,417
[Mrs. Croft] How lovely to see you.

707
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:52,417
-She's injured.
-Shall I ask her?

708
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,542
Anne? Anne, may we offer you a ride home?

709
00:44:57,292 --> 00:45:00,917
-Thank you. I'm quite all right.
-Anne, you've clearly hurt your foot.

710
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,167
It's hardly ten minutes out of our way.
Please, come.

711
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,208
You're so kind.
And I'm so enjoying the fresh air.

712
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:08,833
Must you be so proud?

713
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,625
Please, let this be easy.

714
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,000
[sighs]

715
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,708
[slow melancholic music]

716
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:36,875
[kids screaming]

717
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,042
James.

718
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:43,500
Come here.

719
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,708
I need a favor from you.
Do you think you can help?

720
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:53,625
I need you to hug me so tightly
that I can't feel my body anymore.

721
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,625
-Do you think you can do that?
-Mm-hmm.

722
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,500
[Anne exhales slowly]

723
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,333
James, tea time.

724
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:09,500
Anne. Anne, we are going to Lyme.
Tomorrow.

725
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:12,167
It's been decided.
We'll spend the night by the sea.

726
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,000
To Lyme? Why?

727
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,208
Captain Wentworth wants us
to meet some of his Navy friends.

728
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,792
-I'm not quite up for a trip, I'm afraid.
-What?

729
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:25,750
Anne, we're going to Lyme tomorrow.
I need 24 hours away from the terrors.

730
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,000
No, wait.

731
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,333
Mary, I'm not--

732
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:31,333
No. You're always out to ruin my fun
and I won't have it.

733
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,500
I need a holiday, and I need you with me

734
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,583
to have someone to talk at
when the others stop feeling obligated.

735
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,917
Shockingly self-aware.

736
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,667
[pensive instrumental music]

737
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,167
[seagulls crying]

738
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:51,917
[waves lapping]

739
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,125
[Henrietta laughs]

740
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:07,917
[indistinct chatter]

741
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,000
Captain, this is Anne Elliot.

742
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,000
Anne Elliot.

743
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:21,542
Captain Harville.

744
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,917
Pleasure to meet you.

745
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,458
Please excuse me.

746
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:31,167
Now, you are a fan of poetry.
Or is that just a rumor?

747
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:35,250
You seem to know more of me
than I can hardly be comfortable with.

748
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,208
Forgive me, I'm just hatching a plot.

749
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,125
-You see our friend over there?
-Yes.

750
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,542
[Harville] Captain Benwick.

751
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,792
Now, Captain Benwick has also
considerable taste in reading.

752
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:47,333
But he has fallen into a sadness.

753
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:51,917
I wondered if you might
take a moment to talk to him?

754
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,458
I can build a house out of driftwood,
but don't ever ask me about the Greeks.

755
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:59,250
[Anne laughs] What's the source
of his sorrow?

756
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,833
Home from Troy and there's another man
in his bed? [laughs]

757
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,292
Sorry, Agamemnon joke.

758
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,917
He was engaged to my sister Fanny.

759
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,250
And they were very much in love.

760
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:17,042
And she died while he was at sea,
just before they were set to be married.

761
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,458
I'm so sorry.

762
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:22,000
They say the universe always has a plan.

763
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:24,792
[Anne sighs]

764
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:31,875
-[Harville] So, will you? Speak to him.
-I'd be happy to.

765
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:35,458
Though I'm not sure I'm the messenger
the universe has in mind.

766
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:37,708
Trust me, it's never wrong.

767
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,583
All that is meant for one
is meant to find one.

768
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,667
I promise.

769
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:46,500
[Frederick laughs]

770
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,792
[indistinct chatter]

771
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:51,833
And while you're at it,
convince our friend Wentworth

772
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:54,333
that he'd be a fool
to ignore the Navy much longer.

773
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:56,958
-I hate to see a talent wasted.
-[laughs]

774
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,417
If only I had influence.

775
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,375
Tonight at dinner? You get him drunk.
I'll smuggle him aboard.

776
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:03,958
Perhaps you should ask Louisa.

777
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:05,583
I'm asking you.

778
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:09,667
Shall we?

779
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:14,167
[Harville] Not tempted
to have a dip in the water, are you?

780
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:16,500
Thank you. Promise?

781
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:18,958
Come on, Mary.

782
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,583
[laughter]

783
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:31,333
Wentworth, of course, refused to admit
that he had got the coordinates wrong.

784
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:33,625
Captain Wentworth is very stubborn.

785
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,583
Stubborn indeed.
He could be an admiral some day,

786
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:39,333
great service to the Crown
and all that it holds dear,

787
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:42,625
but instead he'd rather fart around inland
for the rest of his life.

788
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,167
Oh, let the man fart where he likes.

789
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,167
I would like to have a family one day.

790
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,000
As you well know,

791
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:52,125
the wife of a sailor pays a tax
for her husband's chosen path.

792
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,583
It is but a small fee.

793
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:57,458
Constant worry.
I'd hate to ask that of anyone.

794
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:58,542
That's ridiculous.

795
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:00,958
No life is without worry.

796
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:02,375
Harville is right.

797
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:04,958
Anne.

798
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:10,750
Your future wife will be perfectly capable
of managing her own feelings.

799
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:16,125
Don't patronize her by deciding for her
what worries she can and cannot endure.

800
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:17,375
Who knows?

801
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:21,417
Perhaps she'll even be forging
her own adventures at home.

802
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,542
[Harville] Right, who wants more wine?

803
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:24,667
[Henrietta] Yes. Yes.

804
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,458
-Yeah? Okay, good.
-Yes. Yes.

805
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,167
[people chat indistinctly]

806
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,083
[Anne] Lord Byron.

807
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:40,250
"She was my life's unerring light."

808
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,792
"That quench'd,
what beams shall break my night."

809
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:48,333
Yes. [sighs] He's got me
through a self-pitying night or two.

810
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,750
I often think
it is the great misfortune of poetry

811
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,292
that it's seldom enjoyed safely

812
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:57,875
by those capable
of enjoying it completely.

813
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,333
Only people who know loss

814
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,417
can really appreciate Byron.

815
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:06,250
But those people
should only taste him sparingly.

816
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:10,292
Otherwise, they'll be left
more deeply in their sorrow.

817
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:13,375
-Then, what are those people meant to do?
-[Anne chuckles]

818
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,167
Honestly, I've been trying
to work that out for eight years now.

819
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,500
I can only tell you
what I must repeat to myself daily.

820
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:31,417
You're young. You don't know
what the future has in store.

821
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:35,917
You will rally,
and you will be happy again.

822
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,417
-Perhaps you're right.
-[Anne] I know I am.

823
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,792
-Thank you, Miss Elliot.
-[chuckles]

[romantic instrumental music]

826
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:06,000
I'm only saying, the lower ranks
are taxed disproportionately.

[playful music]

828
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:18,042
-[Louisa] Who is that?
-Pardon me. I think I'm in your way.

829
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:20,750
Perhaps you can correct that.

830
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,375
Perhaps.

831
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,167
Hello.

832
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,875
Can I help you with something?

833
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:43,958
Considering what I'd like help with,
probably not.

834
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:48,875
[Frederick] Hmm.

835
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,083
[music stops]

836
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:39,667
Hello.

837
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,542
Hello.

838
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:48,000
-I'm sorry about this morning.
-What happened this morning?

839
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:50,833
I'm speaking of that rude gentleman
we encountered.

840
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,417
I'm not your older brother.
You don't need my protection.

841
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,000
In any event, you've never had trouble
speaking for yourself.

842
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,083
[chuckles]

843
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,542
No apology necessary.

844
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,417
It was clearly well intended.

845
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:13,750
Look, we haven't really
had a chance to talk.

846
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:20,125
I've lived with a thousand different
imagined versions of you over the years.

847
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:22,708
Some to rail against.

848
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:26,458
Some to cherish.

849
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,333
Likewise.

850
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,792
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

851
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,542
Or if you knew how much I cared.

852
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:40,750
I think I always knew.

853
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:45,750
There's no one quite like you.

854
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,042
And it's clear to me
that I want you in my life.

855
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:54,625
No matter what form that takes.
Bury the past and…

856
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:03,333
I suppose what I'm getting at is, um…

857
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,625
I…

858
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,917
I would like to be friends.

859
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:20,292
[melancholic instrumental music]

860
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:27,333
I was… I was thinking the same.

861
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:40,250
I saw so clearly this morning the prison

862
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,833
my resentment had created.

863
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,250
I genuinely hope you find love
wherever you need to find it.

864
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,458
And I thank you,

865
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:54,792
from the bottom of my heart,
for your offer of friendship.

866
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:56,750
Thank you.

867
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:58,250
Thank you.

868
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:01,375
Well…

869
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:04,792
Excellent.

870
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,750
Good… talk.

871
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:15,000
[Anne] I really do hope you'll be open
to pursuing the admiralty.

872
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,917
Everyone speaks to your genius.

873
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:21,625
I'm sure they understate it.

874
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:29,208
They don't really know who I am
or what would make me happy.

875
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:31,000
Well, I do.

876
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:34,208
I know you.

877
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:38,375
And I know you want a life of consequence.

878
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:40,083
And I know you'd be brilliant.

879
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,583
-You want to know a secret?
-Always.

880
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:47,708
[both chuckle]

881
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,875
My most grim moments at sea,

882
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,750
when I felt completely lost and confused

883
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:56,042
and inadequate,

884
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,375
I would ask myself,

885
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,458
"What would Anne do here?"

886
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,833
That's how I'd know how to proceed.

887
00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:08,292
Pretending I was you.

888
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,125
-You lie.
-I truth.

889
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,750
You're always best in an emergency.

890
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:18,417
Anticipating the needs of others.

891
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,375
Direct and focused, calm and thoughtful.

892
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:25,542
Equipped with more intelligence
than does you good.

893
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,500
No, you're an exceptional person.

894
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:33,083
It angers me the world denies you
the chance of a public life.

895
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,458
You'd make a great admiral.

896
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:37,750
Thanks.

897
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:46,625
Don't go out too far.
There's riptides and such.

898
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:52,125
Sorry. There I go
trying to protect you again.

899
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:54,917
As you were.

900
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,458
[Anne chuckles]

901
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:13,750
Now we're worse than exes.

902
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:17,958
We're friends.

903
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:26,542
[melancholic music]

904
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:45,708
[music continues]

905
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:52,542
[music stops]

906
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,708
Now you are in my way.

907
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,375
-Excuse me.
-Before you go,

908
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,250
allow me a proper introduction.

909
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,125
Or is your minder waiting round the corner
to tell me off again?

910
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:15,583
He's my friend,

911
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:19,333
and I believe
he misconstrued your intentions.

912
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:22,500
My intentions were construed
most accurately.

913
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,833
I intended for you to notice me.

914
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:26,875
Miss?

915
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:28,750
Miss.

916
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,083
-Simple. I like it.
-Mm-hmm.

917
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:32,708
Will I see you again?

918
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,208
We must entrust that to providence.

919
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,500
That means I haven't yet made up my mind.

920
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:52,792
What?

921
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:53,833
What is it, Anne?

922
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:56,208
[Anne] The man we passed yesterday.

923
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:05,292
Excuse me. Can you tell me the name
of the gentleman who just left?

924
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,875
That's Mr. William Walter Elliot, miss,
en route to Bath.

925
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,458
Of course he drives off
just as I get to the window.

926
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:17,625
-A cousin?
-Not just a cousin, Henrietta.

927
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:20,500
Our father's heir.
We should write to Father at once.

928
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:23,875
That news would not be welcome,
Mary, as well you know.

929
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:27,083
-[Mary] He'll be furious.
-[Henrietta] What happened between them?

930
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,042
-My father and Mr. Elliot do not speak.
-[gasps]

931
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,708
-I love a little bit of family gossip.
-[Louisa] Tell us.

932
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:35,750
Mr. Elliot will inherit the baronetcy
and the estate no matter what.

933
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:37,958
Father was desperate
that he marry Elizabeth

934
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,042
to keep the title within his direct line.

935
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,708
[Anne] But he turned her down.

936
01:01:41,792 --> 01:01:45,000
We learned that he had married
an American woman who nobody knew.

937
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,292
Father threw a platter of canapés
across the room.

938
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,750
-Wasn't Mr. Elliot in mourning clothes?
-His wife's dead.

939
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,667
You must hate him for all the
embarrassment he's caused your family.

940
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:02,500
Actually, so far
it's his most winning quality.

941
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:25,500
[romantic instrumental music]

942
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:53,375
He's a lucky man to have met Louisa.

943
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:57,750
Hmm. Has he said anything to you
about how he feels?

944
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,208
No, <i>she</i> has.

945
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:07,500
[woman] It's quite steep. Careful.

946
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:12,625
[Louisa laughs]

947
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:15,875
Thank you.

948
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:20,583
Do be careful.

949
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:28,125
-Catch me, Captain.
-[Frederick] Oh, goodness.

950
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,292
-[Louisa laughs]
-[Frederick] Oh.

951
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,625
[both laugh]

952
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:39,875
Okay, that was your warm-up. Once more.

953
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:42,042
No, Louisa, that's enough. No more.

954
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:45,083
I'm jumping, so either catch me or don't.

955
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,000
-Louisa!
-No, no, no, no.

956
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:51,708
-Louisa!
-[Anne] No. Don't move her. Louisa?

957
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:54,375
Can you hear me? Uh, we need a doctor.

958
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:55,333
I'll go.

959
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:58,250
No, someone who knows the town.
Benwick, get a doctor.

960
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,667
-Hurry!
-[Anne] Louisa.

961
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:02,792
-Anne, tell me what can I do?
-Just be patient.

962
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:09,542
[Anne] She's still breathing.
It's all right, she's breathing.

963
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,833
[doctor] She's had
quite a severe concussion.

964
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:14,792
But I've seen far greater injuries
recovered from.

965
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,500
There's reason to be hopeful.

966
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,708
-Leave her to rest now.
-[Mrs. Harville] Yes.

967
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,458
-[doctor] She can stay here?
-Of course.

968
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,083
No, you've been so kind,
we can't continue to impose.

969
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,875
She'll stay as long as she needs.

970
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:32,125
Whoever doesn't mind a spot on the floor
is welcome to stay with her.

971
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,750
Anne should stay.
To assist you, Mrs. Harville.

972
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,333
No one so capable, so perfect as Anne.

973
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,625
-You will stay, won't you?
-Of course.

974
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,417
I can't bear to leave until she's awake.

975
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:47,750
[Frederick] I'll deliver news
to the Musgroves.

976
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,792
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

977
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:52,500
Would you be so kind
as to escort Mary and Henrietta?

978
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,625
Escort me?

979
01:04:54,167 --> 01:04:55,667
The children, Mary.

980
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,083
We can't have them stay
with my parents an extra night.

981
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,542
Nearly burned the house down last time.

982
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:04,917
Why should Anne stay?
Anne who means nothing to Louisa.

983
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,208
-Oh, Mary.
-It was my understanding, Mary,

984
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:10,542
that you suffered from an allergy
to houses of fewer than five servants.

985
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,833
Aren't you worried
you'll contract something?

986
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:16,667
I'm not leaving.
Have a good journey, Anne.

987
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,875
[sorrowful instrumental music]

988
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:35,417
It's not your fault.
You told her not to leap.

989
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,333
In words, yes.

990
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,708
-But in other ways…
-In other ways?

991
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:44,667
I led her to believe I was a person
who was prepared to catch her.

992
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,583
How exactly did you do that?

993
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,250
I knew she was infatuated

994
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,292
and yet did nothing to discourage her.

995
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,042
Clearly, it led to this.

996
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:00,792
Had this not occurred,

997
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,333
one can only imagine
what our lives might have been.

998
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,625
Now I'm responsible for her.

999
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,458
How do I tell her parents?

1000
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:13,125
Calmly.

1001
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:15,542
Be direct.

1002
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:18,208
Offer whatever services
they may require of you.

Good luck.

What will you do now?

1006
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:42,583
I need to go to Bath.

1007
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,333
Thank you.

1008
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:47,542
For everything.

[sorrowful music continues]

1010
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:10,958
How is it

1011
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:15,250
that life can remain static,

1012
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,167
almost obstinately resistant to any change
for years at a time, and then…

1013
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,917
without warning become flooded
with so much newness

1014
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:29,750
within the course of a few weeks?

1015
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:35,583
It's impossible to recall life
before the torrents.

[Lady Russell] That poor girl.
How are her parents?

but trying to stay hopeful.

1018

[Lady Russell] Well,
that's all they can do.

1019
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:50,417
Now, where are they?

Where are they?

-It's fine, we don't need them.
-[sighs]

1022

I wanted it to be perfect for you.

I'm happy just to be here with you.

if they'd forgotten to pack the dessert.

about spending time with someone else?

01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:42,875
There's a reason widowed men die soonest
and unmarried women live longest.

1036
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,458
We're great company.

1037
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:47,958
But do you ever miss… company?

1038
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:48,875
[chuckles]

1039
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,500
Why do you think I take
so many European tours?

1040
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:56,708
Lady Russell!

1041
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:58,208
[Lady Russell laughs]

1042
01:08:58,792 --> 01:08:59,667
Shh.

1043
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:02,250
[playful instrumental music]

1044
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:06,500
I hope I haven't eaten too much.
There's sure to be a feast tonight.

1045
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:08,583
We're to meet the famous Mr. Elliot.

1046
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:11,125
But why is he courting Father's favor now?

1047
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:15,500
Well, Elizabeth, of course, assumes
it is she who motivates him

1048
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:17,542
with all of her charms.

1049
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,208
Mr. Elliot has nothing to gain
from my father.

1050
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,458
He is richer than him
and will inherit his title no matter what.

1051
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:26,792
-He must be after something.
-Why are you so suspicious of him?

1052
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,500
Because anyone that attractive
must have an angle.

1053
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,042
-What are you keeping from me?
-I've seen Mr. Elliot.

1054
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:36,875
And he's attractive.

1055
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,500
Very attractive.

1056
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:41,125
You met him?

1057
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:44,917
In Lyme, though neither of us knew
who we were meeting.

1058
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,875
-Do I sense a romance brewing?
-That's not going to happen.

1059
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:51,667
-Because?
-Because he is a ten.

1060
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,042
I never trust a ten.

1061
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,250
Oh!

1062
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:59,000
[Lady Russell] This is you.

1063
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,625
[bells ringing]

1064
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,083
[Anne] This is his idea of downsizing?

1065
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,000
[Lady Russell] It's a start.

1066
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,042
Don't make me.

1067
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:08,583
<i>Courage, ma chérie.</i>

1068
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:10,250
I'll see you tonight.

1069
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:24,000
[playful instrumental music]

1070
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:38,333
-Anne! I'm so happy to see you.
-What do you mean by that?

1071
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:42,250
Mr. Elliot is on his way and I want him
to see what I look like next to you.

1072
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:44,417
-It's good to be home.
-Just think.

1073
01:10:44,917 --> 01:10:47,167
He's been nursing a crush on me
for nearly a decade.

1074
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:49,500
Poor man. How he must have suffered.

1075
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,292
All the way through a marriage
he ran away from you to secure.

1076
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:56,500
Isn't it mad? He must have presumed
I was out of his league.

1077
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,792
I can't imagine any other reason.

1078
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,833
I'm never quite sure
whether you're insulting me,

1079
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:05,542
but I value your regard so little
that I don't mind either way.

1080
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:08,458
Ah, Anne. Is that what you're wearing?

1081
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:11,375
Mr. Elliot will be here any moment.

1082
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,750
I was surprised, Father,

1083
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,667
to learn how forgiving you've been
after all he made you suffer.

1084
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,583
Suffer?

1085
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,500
Well, there were many insults.

1086
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:20,958
He denies making them.

1087
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:22,667
Father, he made them <i>to</i> you.

1088
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:25,708
He was very strong in his denial.

1089
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:27,167
[knock on door]

1090
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,667
Oh, that's him.

1091
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,583
Get the door, Anne. And don't slouch.

1092
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:33,792
Hurry up!

1093
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,667
Gosh.

1094
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,167
[sighs]

1095
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:44,958
Thank you.

1096
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:47,958
Ah.

1097
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:56,083
It seems like providence
plays for my team after all.

1098
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:58,000
I'm your cousin, Anne.

1099
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:59,958
Cousin? Interesting.

1100
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:05,167
It's a decided step up from passerby,
but still a bit short of "most beloved".

1101
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,167
But I am willing to work for my titles.

1102
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,167
Imagine my luck,
a flirt and a hard worker.

1103
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,375
Don't forget rich.

1104
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:13,375
Lucky we have you to remind us.

1105
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,667
What in God's name is happening?

1106
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,000
Don't worry, darling,
he's just practicing on me.

1107
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:22,500
Shall we?

1108
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:25,625
[piano music]

1109
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:28,958
[piano music in the room]

1110
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,083
[clears his throat]

1111
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:51,083
I understand you've been visiting
my sister quite often.

1112
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,750
She is delighted by the attention.

1113
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:59,042
Well, it's nice to hear
that your sister is capable of delight.

1114
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:02,250
But romance has been
the last thing from my mind.

1115
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:04,542
Until today.

1116
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:05,958
[laughs]

1117
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:10,542
Well, if you haven't been coming
for the purpose of courtship, then…

1118
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:15,375
-[Elliot] Mrs. Clay, of course.
-Mrs. Clay?

1119
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:19,125
About a month ago, I received word
that my uncle had appeared in Bath

1120
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:21,292
in the company of a woman of low birth.

1121
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:24,292
Many presumed she was after his hand.

1122
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:26,833
Now, that marriage would be a scandal.

1123
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:29,333
You're concerned
for my father's reputation?

1124
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:30,875
Oh, no, not at all.

1125
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:35,458
My concern is that he will have a son
and that son will rob me of my title

1126
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:37,125
and my estate.

1127
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:40,125
And my plan is to block that
by any means necessary.

1128
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,750
I told you,
I'm willing to work for my titles.

1129
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:44,667
[Anne chuckles]

1130
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:48,833
I have to say,
I am impressed by your openness.

1131
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:50,167
Refreshing, yes?

1132
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,417
I'm so glad to see you again.

1133
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,375
I heard about that terrible accident
that befell your party after I left Lyme.

1134
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,208
How is she?

1135
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:03,125
She's still confined to her bed,
but much recovered.

1136
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:05,042
I received word this morning.

1137
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,375
Thank you for asking.

1138
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:10,542
-You must have suffered terribly.
-I suffered the least, truly.

1139
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:16,167
You have a gentle soul.
You feel deeply for those around you.

1140
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:19,250
I imagine it was quite an ordeal.
I regret you had to go through it.

1141
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,125
Thank you.

1142
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,042
[piano stops]

1143
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,750
[guests applaud]

1144
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,583
So good, darling.

1145
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:31,125
Mm.

1146
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:36,000
-Go forth. You have my blessing.
-I wouldn't do anything without it.

1147
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:36,917
[chuckles]

1148
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:38,750
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

1149
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:41,333
[Elliot] Bravo. Very well played, madam.

1150
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:46,167
He means to disarm me with candor.

1151
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,667
It isn't working. [chuckles]

1152
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:50,750
Yet.

1153
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:52,500
Probably won't.

1154
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:54,958
Right?

1155
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,333
Ow.

1156
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:13,625
[munches]

1157
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:19,250
[Sir Walter hums]

1158
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:29,208
[screams]

1159
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:30,833
-What?
-Joy.

1160
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:33,250
Pardon me, I'm experiencing joy.

1161
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,458
The dowager Viscountess Dalrymple
and her daughter,

1162
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:40,375
the honorable Miss Carteret,

1163
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,958
are in Bath.

1164
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:44,250
[squealing]

1165
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,417
Do you rehearse this stuff
while I'm sleeping?

1166
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,583
Our dear cousins!

1167
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:49,667
Cousins? I love cousins!

1168
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,583
Cousin is a term most accurately applied
to those within one's family tree,

1169
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:57,875
not those within one's family forest.

1170
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:01,333
The Dalrymples don't have
the slightest notion that we exist.

1171
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:04,167
With the help of a few visual aids,

1172
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,167
I bet we could explain the connections
most comprehensively

1173
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:09,542
within three quarters of an hour.

1174
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:11,500
-But why?
-[Sir Walter] Why?

1175
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:15,375
These people are nobility.
Everyone will want to be seen with them.

1176
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:17,708
What's the advantage
of being seen with them?

1177
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:20,542
Anne, don't be deliberately dense.

1178
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,625
Quick! Break out your finest frocks.

1179
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:29,250
We are about to touch… greatness.

1180
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:31,250
[silence]

1181
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,917
[clock ticking in the room]

1182
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:43,875
[bird cooing outside]

1183
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,000
[teaspoon clinking]

1184
01:16:58,083 --> 01:16:59,250
[birds chirping]

1185
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:19,250
[slurps]

1186
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:32,375
Sometimes, I have this dream

1187
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:37,833
that a giant octopus is sucking my face
and, as I struggle to get free,

1188
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:41,125
I realize that my, my hands are tentacles

1189
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,333
and I can't push it off.

1190
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:45,958
And then I realize, of course, that I am

1191
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:48,792
the octopus, and I am

1192
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,125
sucking my own

1193
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:54,583
face.

1194
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:55,875
[ticking continues]

1195
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:01,417
Much like in life.

1196
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,375
So often those we perceive
as our greatest adversaries

1197
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:07,667
are just shadow versions of ourselves.

1198
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,958
Well put, Mr. Elliot.

1199
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,583
Hmm.

1200
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:14,333
Perhaps the next time
you meet an octopus, Miss Elliot,

1201
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:18,125
you should embrace him,
rather than try to detach.

1202
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,833
Wrap those wily tendrils right around him

1203
01:18:21,917 --> 01:18:23,792
and let yourself be taken.

1204
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,000
[chuckles]

1205
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,458
In your dreams, Mr. Elliot.

1206
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:31,375
And also in mine.

1207
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,917
It was on account of eating some cheese

1208
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,917
a bit too close to bedtime.

1209
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,958
-Oh.
-Well, that went splendidly.

1210
01:18:45,042 --> 01:18:46,833
I knew it would. [laughs]

1211
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:51,958
Your charms are irresistible, Sir Walter,
even to nobility. [laughs]

1212
01:18:55,292 --> 01:18:57,833
Your noble relations disappoint you.

1213
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
[sighs]

1214
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:04,708
That awful woman
cannot marry your father. Ugh.

1215
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,417
[Anne] Tell me something.

1216
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:11,125
You'd honestly rather prevent Mrs. Clay
from taking my father's arm

1217
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,667
than talk with me?

1218
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:16,833
My dear octopus, it's not even close.

1219
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:19,500
You know…

1220
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,375
you're beginning to grow on me.

1221
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:26,667
Now I'm suspicious.

1222
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,875
[playful instrumental music]

1223
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:32,458
[Elliot] Fascinating.

1224
01:19:36,167 --> 01:19:38,875
[Lady Russell giggles]
Must everyone be interesting?

1225
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:42,000
[Anne] Not at all. They are free
to be as boring as they like

1226
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:44,583
so long as I am not asked
to sit with them.

1227
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,250
And him?

1228
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:52,500
[Anne chuckles]

1229
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:55,833
He provided some relief.
More than I anticipated.

1230
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:56,917
[Lady Russell] Hmm.

1231
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,833
He spoke quite highly of you to me
the other night.

1232
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:02,375
I believe there is some attachment.

1233
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:06,958
Mr. Elliot could attach to a potato
if it suited him.

1234
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:23,000
Though Elizabeth may find
some satisfaction living at home forever,

1235
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:25,333
that life will lock you in deadness.

1236
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:29,750
All I'm saying is,
I hope you will accept Mr. Elliot

1237
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,625
if he makes an offer.

1238
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,208
Based on your extensive knowledge of him?

1239
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:39,000
I may not have extensive knowledge of him,
but I have extensive knowledge of you.

1240
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:43,083
Not only is he rich and well-mannered,

1241
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:46,542
I believe you've taken an interest in him.

1242
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:49,333
I would never have recommended it
otherwise.

1243
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:54,917
I'll admit, there is something there.

1244
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,750
But, for once, I'm asking you to trust
that I have the resources

1245
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,292
to make my own decisions.

1246
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:06,042
I must rely on the instructions
issued by my own heart.

1247
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:09,375
I tried the alternative once
and I'll never forgive myself for it.

1248
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,000
You mean you'll never forgive me.

1249
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:21,125
I just thought, under the circumstances…

1250
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,167
Circumstances?

1251
01:21:24,917 --> 01:21:27,708
[Lady Russell] The engagement, of course.
Wentworth and Louisa.

1252
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:34,042
Oh, I thought you knew.

1253
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:38,667
Everyone is talking
about Louisa and her captain.

1254
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:41,958
Oh, darling.

1255
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,708
What can I do?

1256
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:49,292
[exhales] I'd just like to be alone.

1257
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:54,125
Well, I'm here when you want me.

1258
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:59,250
[sorrowful instrumental music]

1259
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:15,667
[music continues]

1260
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:19,208
[shuddering breaths]

1261
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:28,292
I always imagined myself

1262
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:30,000
confronting this moment

1263
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:32,833
with grace.

1264
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:39,542
I would astonish myself and others
with my…

1265
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:42,792
My quiet dignity.

1266
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:46,583
My ability to endure.

1267
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:51,542
Statues would be erected in my name.

1268
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:54,458
"In memory of Anne Elliot,

1269
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,667
who suffered cosmic loss

1270
01:22:57,375 --> 01:23:00,667
yet really held it together
quite impressively."

1271
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:04,750
[sighs]

1272
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:12,875
[music builds]

1273
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,292
[music slows down, then stops]

1274
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:45,875
Mm.

1275
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,125
Anne.

1276
01:23:58,583 --> 01:24:01,625
-You're here.
-Yes, it appears I am.

1277
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:04,458
-Are you alone?
-Mm.

1278
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:07,708
I'm just waiting for a friend.

1279
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:09,375
I see.

1280
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:13,083
We got caught in the rain.
He's gone to fetch a carriage.

1281
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:15,750
He's quite charming.

1282
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:19,250
-Well, I'm pleased to hear that.
-He makes me laugh.

1283
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,375
It's nice to laugh. [laughs]

1284
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:24,542
Apparently, you've yet to hear
about the engagement. I'm--

1285
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:27,125
I'm sorry, the horses
were a nightmare in the rain.

1286
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:32,500
-Uh, Mr. Elliot, allow me to introduce--
-We remember each other.

1287
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,542
We do.

1288
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,542
[Elliot] Mm.

1289
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:37,042
[exhales]

1290
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:39,125
Th-this is Captain Wentworth.

1291
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:41,833
Yes, your good friend Captain Wentworth.

1292
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:46,417
I'm glad to have the opportunity
to, uh, apologize for my behavior in Lyme.

1293
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:49,625
It was on account of being struck by this

1294
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,292
dazzling creature.

1295
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:54,000
Please don't call me a creature.

1296
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:56,167
This dazzling, um…

1297
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,583
[Anne] Woman? Woman?

1298
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:01,250
-What's wrong with creature?
-We'll talk about it later.

1299
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,625
What is taking you two so long?

1300
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:06,375
Um, just one second. One second.

1301
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:09,458
There's a concert tomorrow.
Will you join us?

1302
01:25:09,542 --> 01:25:11,958
-Oh, I'd hate to intrude.
-On what?

1303
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,208
You'll come, then. Excellent.

1304
01:25:15,292 --> 01:25:17,875
We'll be a foursome.
You, she, the bel canto and me.

1305
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,750
He's quite original, isn't he?

1306
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,917
Unique, even.

1307
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,750
It's good to see you happy.

1308
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,125
Thanks.

1309
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,958
I hope you're happy too.

1310
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:39,375
Anne, I think we should be going.

1311
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,125
I'll see you tomorrow.

1312
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,208
[Elizabeth] Anne! Hurry up!

1313
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,292
[melancholic music builds]

1314
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:09,167
[overlapping chatter]

1315
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:16,750
[quiet laughter in the room]

1316
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:18,417
Good evening.

1317
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,208
Shall we?

1318
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:30,208
How's Louisa?

1319
01:26:30,292 --> 01:26:31,292
Very much recovered.

1320
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:33,417
And yet still healing slowly.

1321
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:36,708
It's going to take time and love
to see her through.

1322
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:39,375
Good.

1323
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:45,333
So long as you're in Bath,
I hope we can see a bit of one another.

1324
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:47,542
I'm actually not sure
how long I'll be here.

1325
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:51,833
I'm in the throes of a difficult decision.
Been offered a position aboard a ship.

1326
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:53,542
Oh.

1327
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:58,542
She sets sail for Malta Saturday,
so I don't have long to make up my mind.

1328
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,208
-Well, that sounds exciting.
-Indeed it does.

1329
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:04,417
I love my work and I'm happy
for the opportunity to serve, but--

1330
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,583
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to steal my Anne for a moment.

1331
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:11,750
Fluent in Italian too,
would you believe it?

1332
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:14,958
-Uh, we need help translating the program.
-Just one moment.

1333
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,250
Anne, we need you to do Italian
for our cousins.

1334
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,208
I do hope you'll be able
to make it to the wedding.

1335
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:35,833
Anne would be devastated
if you weren't there.

1336
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,875
I know how much
she values your friendship.

1337
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:48,458
[stringed music]

1338
01:27:50,417 --> 01:27:51,625
[indistinct chatter]

1339
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,958
[sings in Italian]

1340
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:23,000
[door opens]

1341
01:29:27,417 --> 01:29:28,250
[door closes]

1342
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:36,708
[singing continues]

1343
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:37,625
Frederick!

1344
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:42,958
I was hoping we could continue
our conversation.

1345
01:29:43,542 --> 01:29:45,625
Sadly, I'm not sure
there will be another opportunity.

1346
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:52,583
I've just made up my mind. I'm off to sea.
Much to put in order before Saturday.

1347
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:55,167
I'm sorry, I'm interrupting again.

1348
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,750
No, no, no.
I'm afraid it is I who is interrupting.

1349
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,208
Enjoy the second act.

1350
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:04,667
[Mr. Elliot] We will.

1351
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:09,250
-I didn't mean to upset--
-If you would just let me speak.

1352
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:13,583
You interrupted me.
Let me say what's on my mind first.

1353
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:17,583
I'm new to these genuine feelings.

1354
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,625
I'm trying to learn from you, for you.

1355
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:23,875
You're far too good for me
and I'm terrified.

1356
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,250
But I want very much to make you my wife.

1357
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:30,583
Nothing else would make me happier.

1358
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,333
-Your wife?
-Yes. You don't have to answer now.

1359
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:40,417
But please, think on it.

1360
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,167
[music and singing continue]

1361
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:47,542
The captain was right, you know.

1362
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,667
[music and singing continue]

1363
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,250
The gentleman is indeed unique.

1364
01:31:05,417 --> 01:31:06,708
[music and singing fade]

1365
01:31:10,667 --> 01:31:11,875
[loud knock on door]

1366
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:14,792
Ow.

1367
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,583
Charles, hurry up!

1368
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:21,875
Ow.

1369
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:23,500
Ow.

1370
01:31:24,167 --> 01:31:25,042
[Mary groans]

1371
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,542
The journey gave me dead leg.
I need you to massage it.

1372
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,375
Mary, what are you doing here?

1373
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:32,208
Uh, coming to fetch you, of course.

1374
01:31:33,042 --> 01:31:35,875
You need to come to the inn
with Charles and me to listen to me talk.

1375
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:37,750
We're here for a little visit.

1376
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:43,625
Ever since Louisa's accident,
life just seems so fragile and fleeting.

1377
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:48,125
It's made me realize how important it is
to spend time away from one's children.

1378
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:52,708
And it's dreadfully unfair that you
and Elizabeth are up here gallivanting

1379
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:54,583
with Mr. Elliot and our noble cousins

1380
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:56,542
and I haven't even been introduced
to them yet,

1381
01:31:57,042 --> 01:32:00,958
despite being the most accomplished
decoupage artist of the three of us. Hmm?

1382
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:05,625
Oh, Anne, have you heard?

1383
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:07,708
Louisa will marry a sailor

1384
01:32:07,792 --> 01:32:11,167
and Henrietta that soiled napkin
of a curate, Henry Hayter.

1385
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,750
Mary, remember your list.

1386
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:14,042
Oh, right.

1387
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:19,250
My doctor thinks I might benefit
from embodying gratitude.

1388
01:32:20,208 --> 01:32:22,333
So every time something terrible
happens in my life,

1389
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:24,000
I'm to think up something I'm glad for.

1390
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:27,708
For example, the fact that both my sisters
are madly in love and about to be married?

1391
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,083
No, that does nothing for me.

1392
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:33,333
Well, I'm delighted for them both.

1393
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:35,542
And I will come and visit later.

1394
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:38,333
-Where are you going?
-[Anne] Um…

1395
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,250
I have plans.

1396
01:32:42,542 --> 01:32:43,583
What plans?

1397
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:49,500
Upstairs? You don't even have any friends
and all your relations are in this house.

1398
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:53,333
I hate to agree with my wife, Anne,
but I've been given explicit instructions

1399
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:56,667
not to return to the inn without you.
It'll be a little Lyme reunion.

1400
01:32:58,417 --> 01:33:01,625
Captain Harville was quite charmed by you
and delighted for the prospect

1401
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,208
of renewing your acquaintance.

1402
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:04,833
He's gone to fetch Wentworth just now.

1403
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:08,292
How unfortunate you have other plans.

1404
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:20,250
[indistinct chatter]

1405
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:23,583
Anne.

1406
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,500
I've missed you.

1407
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:29,667
[Harville] We need to give Wentworth
a proper send-off.

1408
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:33,500
[Charles] Absolutely.
A few drinks, a game of cards.

1409
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:36,458
Although I understand
Anne has other plans.

1410
01:33:37,042 --> 01:33:38,250
I'm no card player.

1411
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,417
Worst I've ever seen.

1412
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:45,292
That was then. Time makes many changes.

1413
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:47,125
I'm not yet so much changed.

1414
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,167
Wentworth, sorry to interrupt
but I will not rest

1415
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,000
until that letter is signed
and delivered to Admiral Croft.

1416
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:56,958
You've been very slippery
these past few months.

1417
01:33:57,042 --> 01:33:57,875
Of course.

1418
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:06,917
Are we finished?

1419
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:09,708
I suppose so.

1420
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,375
I'll be just a moment.

1421
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:27,292
You look a bit sad, Captain Harville.

1422
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:29,958
Well, actually, I should be happy.

1423
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:32,667
Captain Benwick has found love at last.

1424
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:36,875
That's wonderful.
I should think you would be pleased.

1425
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:39,417
You were so determined
to see him out of his misery.

1426
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:43,542
But I hadn't anticipated
the effect it would have on me.

1427
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:48,500
It's as if his suffering
was keeping my sister alive somehow.

1428
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:53,708
Poor Fanny. She would never
have forgotten him so soon.

1429
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,917
Well, that's certain.

1430
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:59,750
We women do not forget you
so soon as you forget us.

1431
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,625
Women love beyond all sensible limits.

1432
01:35:04,667 --> 01:35:06,333
We cannot help ourselves.

1433
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:10,750
I don't mean to venture any claims about
the differences between men and women.

1434
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:12,375
[Anne] Oh, well, I will.

1435
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:16,167
The only privilege I claim for my sex
is that of loving longest.

1436
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:20,917
Loving even when hope is gone.

1437
01:35:22,542 --> 01:35:25,125
Loving because you don't have a choice.

1438
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:34,000
-[Frederick] I'm finished.
-[Harville] Thank you.

1439
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:45,542
[chuckles]

1440
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,292
There is no quarreling with you.

1441
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:52,958
I think Fanny would be happy
to see her Benwick cared for.

1442
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:55,208
[Harville] Fanny was never
the jealous type.

1443
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:58,500
In moments I've wondered if it wasn't
my sister's spirit in the wind

1444
01:35:58,583 --> 01:35:59,958
that caused Louisa to slip,

1445
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,042
knowing somehow
eventually where she would land.

1446
01:36:04,042 --> 01:36:04,958
Louisa?

1447
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:08,500
I've told you,

1448
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:12,583
the universe has perfect timing.

1449
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:17,000
And when you had the presence of mind
to tell Benwick to fetch a surgeon,

1450
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:20,250
you must have had no idea the wheels
that you were setting in motion.

1451
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,708
Captain, I'm afraid I'm lost.

1452
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,208
I'm speaking of Louisa's engagement
to Captain Benwick, of course.

1453
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:28,125
A love grown slow and sure

1454
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:31,167
from his constant attention
to her during her convalescence.

1455
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,000
Of what did you think I was speaking?

1456
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:37,208
I don't know.

1457
01:36:38,917 --> 01:36:41,583
[Harville] I'll make sure
this letter gets to Admiral Croft.

1458
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:10,083
"Dear Anne…"

"But of course you have not seen this.
How could you?"

1470
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:54,458
"Because your love has not lasted
as long as mine."

1471
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,833
"Anne…
